This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed for the IT Elective subject as part of an assignment. The main purpose of the project is to help users manage a reading list by allowing them to add books along with their details. Each book entry includes the book name, the author's name, the type of book (either Fiction or Non-Fiction), a target date for completion, and a status to indicate whether the book is still being read or has been completed.

A key feature of this project is a checkbox that allows users to mark a book as Completed once they’ve finished reading it, or leave it as Ongoing if they haven’t. Users can also:

- Edit existing book entries to update any of the details.

- Delete books from the list if they’re no longer relevant.

The system uses a MySQL database named task3_assignment_elective
